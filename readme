# Rembg Setup and Build Instructions

## 1. Create a Conda Environment

Create a new Conda environment with Python 3.11:

```bash
conda create -n rembg python=3.11
conda activate rembg
```
2. Install Required Dependencies
Install the necessary dependencies from requirements.txt:
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```
3. Run the Script Locally
Run the main Python script using the following command:
```bash
python main.py --input input.png --output output.png
```
Make sure to replace input.png and output.png with your desired input and output file paths.

Build Executable using auto-py-to-exe
1. Install auto-py-to-exe
If you haven't already, install auto-py-to-exe:

pip install auto-py-to-exe
2. Configure auto-py-to-exe
Open auto-py-to-exe by running auto-py-to-exe in your terminal.
Select main.py as your script.
Add requirements.txt and any other additional files if needed.
Choose the desired settings for your executable (e.g., one-file or directory).
3. Build the Executable
Click on the Build button in the auto-py-to-exe interface to compile your script into an executable.

Running the Executable
1. Navigate to the Build Directory
After building the executable, navigate to the output directory where the .exe file is located. For example:

cd rembg\output\main
2. Run the Executable
Run the executable using the following command:

script_name.exe input_image.jpg output_image.png
Make sure to replace input_image.jpg and output_image.png with your actual input and output paths.
